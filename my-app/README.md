### My introduction to React

I am following allong "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

This was my first ever project done with React and I decided to push all the updates here
in order to see the workflow and how the code evolves over time. As well as extra practice
for using Git and Github.

## Technology Used

-   React JS
-   Redux / Redux Thunk / Redux Saga
-   Firebase
